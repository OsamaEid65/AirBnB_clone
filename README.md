# AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! This project is the first step toward building a full web application that mimics the functionality of AirBnB. Before you start, please familiarize yourself with the [AirBnB concept page](#).

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a command interpreter that manages AirBnB objects. This command interpreter allows you to perform various operations on objects, such as creating new objects, retrieving objects from files or databases, performing operations on objects, updating object attributes, and destroying objects.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is similar to a Shell but is tailored to the specific needs of our project. With the command interpreter, you can:

- Create a new object (e.g., a new User or a new Place).
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc.
- Perform operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.).
- Update attributes of an object.
- Destroy an object.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AirBnB Clone command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/OsamaEid65/AirBnB_clone.git
$ cd AirBnB_clone
